# miRNA-Lab
Welcome to the miRNA Lab. The goal of this project is as follows:

1) Display 7-mer sequence data in a variety of graphs
2) Organize data in a succinct and understandable way. 

The process begins with the sequencing of miRNA, which exist as 7 character nucleotide sequences. These 7-mer strands pair with corresponding sites on Poly(A), which trigger the repression of certain genes. To measure this, our lab takes the available data of zebrafish 3'UTR genes and counts all possible canonical sites. We then compare the frequency of available sites to the abundance of actual miRNA found in zebrafish specimen. The goal of this project is to produce representative data in a myriad of ways for all animals with available data. To do this, modular, streamlined scripts will be made and tested on zebrafish first, which can then be applied to other animals' data. 

Each graph is designated a different 'project'. Each project contains explanations on how each table of data was created. The only thing assumed is that you have access to the original data provided on various genome databases online. The rest of the data is a compilation or manipulation of those starting points and so I find it necessary to explain how I produced the data for sake of clarity.
